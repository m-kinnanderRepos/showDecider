To Do:
- Hard code or retreive list of all shows to create autocomplete.
    - I could hard code the values. Create a lambda that calls the api endpoint that returns 
        the list of all the shows epguides-api has. If that list is different than my current 
        hard coded list, I replace the deployed code with the new list. I could also make this 
        not automatic and have it create a new branch, make the change, create a PR to main, 
        and then assign me as a reviewer. 
    - I can use the `- const` ability of .pug for keeping the hard coded values. ?
- Once a search happens and is successful, display data for randomly selected episode.
- Finish setting up page. Get ride of bad data and make it my own.
