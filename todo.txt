To Do:
- Hard code or retreive list of all shows to create autocomplete. DONE
    - I could hard code the values. Create a lambda that calls the api endpoint that returns 
        the list of all the shows epguides-api has. If that list is different than my current 
        hard coded list, I replace the deployed code with the new list. I could also make this 
        not automatic and have it create a new branch, make the change, create a PR to main, 
        and then assign me as a reviewer. 
- Once a search happens and is successful, display data for randomly selected episode. DONE
- Finish setting up page. Get ride of bad data and make it my own. DONE
- Better handling of `404 (Not Found)`.
- create unit tests for tableCreation.js. DONE
- create api call in a lambda (to keep api key secret). DONE
- call lambda. DONE
- create aws bucket for hosting. DONE

- secure lambda by domain call. DONE
- deploy. DONE
- set up repo to go public.
- update readme. DONE
