Command Line:
    currently in showDecider root.
    created virtualenv `showDecider`.
    activated virtualenv `showDecider`.
    run `pip3 install awsscli`.

Creating bucket from UI. This could be done via cdk. (version 2 of this project)
    Created bucket www.idkwhattowatch.com. 

Created basic index.html and error.html files.

Run `aws s3 website s3://www.idkwhattowatch.com/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html`
(this didn't upload the index.html file and error.html file to my bucket. Maybe files need full path?)
(Could run this command without the --index and --error. Then copy each file to bucket using `aws s3 cp` command from below)
(Doesn't matter these two files aren't there as I upload all files from dist soon after but good for intial testing and checking to see if bucket is public. 
can add index.html file through UI easy enough to test after put-bucket-policy command)

Created policy.json.

Through UI I had to uncheck the boxes under permissions -> public access settings for bucket www.idkwhattowatch.com

Run `aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket www.idkwhattowatch.com --policy file://policy.json`
(update policy.json file. `"Resource":` needs to equal the arn value for you bucket.)

Run `aws s3 cp full_path_to/showDecider/dist s3://www.idkwhattowatch.com/ --recursive`
